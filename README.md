## Description
This is a dice game that involves two people. The players get to roll the dice and the values are added cumulatively until the first playere that reaches 100 gets to win.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Access to strong internet connection.
* A device that has access to the internet.
* Enough space in your device to hold the game
As a user you don't need a server to be able to access the game, neither do you need to download an additional package.
## Known Bugs
The game might not be responsive on all devices.
## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the game. I also used some of the styled bootstrap classes that helped in styling the game.
